Operating System Project
Description: Develop a secure file management system that incorporates authentication
mechanisms (password-based, two-factor), protection measures (access control, encryption), and
detection of common security threats (buffer overflow, malware). Users should be able to perform
file operations like read, write, share, and view metadata securely.
